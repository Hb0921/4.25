      <p class="p1">
      Our school was originally called Tongwen Middle School, which meant to integrate colleagues to rejuvenate 
      the country and educate people. It was built very early and has been built for many years. 
      Now it has been a first-class key middle school in Zhejiang Province, and it is also a century-old 
      school in Zhejiang Province.The school focuses on the design concept of "standardization, 
      modernization and human culture". The campus environment is elegant and clean, with rich cultural 
      atmosphere and first-class education and teaching facilities.This is the beautiful campus where I 
      once studied.
